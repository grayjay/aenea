This directory is for language specific syntax files for VIM using the
plug-in UltiSnips (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). Currently, the
verbal equivalent slip inside grammar/verbal_emacs/insertions.py, though
the long-term plan is to implement some kind of plug-in management into
verbal_emacs.

These are more work-in-progress than most of the project, and subject
to change.
